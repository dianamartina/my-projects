I try to prove a part of my hard skills and personality through this website showcasing a part of my work presented in a nice shape, designed by me.

On the about section and contact are more information and details about me.
All projects including this one are mobile responsive, the approach is desktop first having as audience medium to large viewports.

I am passionate about front-end so I try to do my best on presenting my work etique, code implementation and good practices, that’s why all the project have a very high score on validations(e.g. Google Lighthouse).

## About this project:

One page application, using only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, structured in sections using grid and flexbox to position the elements.

Icons and animations are SVG types, the photos(webp) are optimized for different viewports and device pixel ratios and the colors are introduced through CSS variables.

On the projects section, each project has the same structure in HTML and the zig-zag position and fade in effect it is added through JS on scroll.

The UI design it’s original, developed first in Figma and converted to code.
